# Predicting-PM2.5-in-Air-
The Beijing PM2.5 Data Data Set is a comprehensive collection of air pollution data specifically focused on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller) levels in Beijing, China.PM2.5 is considered a major air pollutant and has significant impacts on human health and the environment.

First we load the dataset after that we perform the data processing and Exploratory Data Analysis.
After getting the knowledge about the data we perfrom modeling techniques like Ridge regression and Random Forest Regressor.
we will evaluate the model and try to perform cross validation for better performance.
